Greymatter-to-tumblr

After many harrowing years of blogging using greymatter (I know, right?), I finally moved everything to tumblr.  On the off chance that someone, somewhere, might ever need to do migrate their old greymatter blog posts to tumblr (I know, right??), here's some python to do it.  First, pull all of your greymatter html files over, then run this python script with your tumblr OATH creds to post each html file as a new tumblr post.  I'm sure that there are tons of bugs, etc., so apologies in advance.  Hopefully, no one will ever use this.
